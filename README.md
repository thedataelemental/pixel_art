# pixel_art
Miscellaneous pixel art of mine from smaller projects.

The Legend of Dragoon folder is for remastered battle UI icons I've drawn to contribute to an ongoing fan project remastering the game.
The game's battle UI icons didn't take well to AI upscaling, so they needed an artist to draw them by hand, and I volunteered. 
Everything in the LoD folder is 64x64 resolution.

This repo is expected to grow over time.
